Nate Robbins created the original GLM library. He also ported GLUT for
Windows and has many great examples of OpenGL in
action. <http://www.xmission.com/~nate/>

The gluiobj, glutobj and game_glutobj programs, as well as the
blending code, come from GLM_AVL. <http://www.avl.iu.edu/projects/GLM_AVL/>

Frederic Devernay <Frederic.Devernay at m4x dot org> did the rest.
